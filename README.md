# Code Workouts
Repository for Code Workouts of the Day üí™üèº

## Introduction
The idea is to improve programming skills through practice and repetition, a movement commonly known as [_kata_ or _code kata_](http://codekata.com/).\
Karate is not that familiar to me, but CrossFit&copy; is. In this modality, there is a continuous hone of basic/simple skills and chaining of those, contributing to the mastery of more complex movements, then applied in a [WOD](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/) (Workout Of the Day). The concept is applied here &mdash; continuous learning through CWOD (Code Workout of the Day).
