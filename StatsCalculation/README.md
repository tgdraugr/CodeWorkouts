# Stats Calculation

Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics:

* minimum value
* maximum value
* number of elements in the sequence
* average value

For example: 

    Given [6, 9, 15, -2, 92, 11]
    minimum value = -2
    maximum value = 92
    number of elements in the sequence = 6
    average value = 21.833333
